## Workshop Day (1 hour before)

### Setup
- [ ] Print student guide pages (1 per group, or display on screen)
- [ ] Set up 4 student devices (phones/tablets)
- [ ] Test WiFi is working and strong
- [ ] Confirm all 4 QR codes are visible/accessible
- [ ] Have backups of QR code links written down

### Before Students Arrive
- [ ] Clear test objects from scenes
- [ ] Do a final AR test
- [ ] Have instructions ready to display
- [ ] Brief your co-teachers/TAs on the interface

---

## During Workshop

### Introduction (5 min)
- [ ] Explain: "You'll build a 3D scene together that you can see in AR"
- [ ] Show a 30-second demo on projector
- [ ] Give each group their QR code

### Building Phase (15-20 min)
- [ ] Circulate and help groups get comfortable
- [ ] Encourage experimentation
- [ ] Help with AR viewing if needed

### AR Viewing (10 min)
- [ ] Have groups view in AR
- [ ] Help position phones correctly
- [ ] Take photos!

### Sharing (5 min)
- [ ] Have groups export scene links
- [ ] Optional: Display other groups' creations
- [ ] Screenshot everything for documentation

---

## After Workshop

- [ ] Download scene JSONs from each group
- [ ] Archive links for future reference
- [ ] Collect student feedback
- [ ] Consider publishing best scenes on your school site

---

## Troubleshooting Reference

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Page won't load" | Check internet, hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) |
| "Objects won't drag" | Tap directly on object, ensure it's not on ground plane |
| "AR not working" | Try different device, check camera permissions |
| "Can't see other group's scene" | Copy full URL including `?scene=...` part |
| "Too many objects, gets slow" | 20-30 objects is typical max per scene |

---

## Success Metrics

âœ… All students can add objects
âœ… All students can view in AR
âœ… All groups successfully export a scene
âœ… Students express excitement/engagement
âœ… You have photos/videos of AR viewing

---

## Post-Workshop

### Share Results
```
Email to parents/admin:
"Today [School] students collaborated in groups 
to build 3D scenes and view them in AR using 
a custom web application. See their creations:

Group 1: [link]
Group 2: [link]
Group 3: [link]
Group 4: [link]"
```

### Iterate for Next Time
- [ ] Note what objects students requested
- [ ] Consider pre-loading a scene for demo
- [ ] Add more 3D models if desired
- [ ] Get more AR time if you had to cut short
