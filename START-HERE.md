## Next Steps (Quick Version)

### 1. Deploy to GitHub Pages (15 minutes)

**Go to:** https://github.com/new
1. Create repo named `student-ar-builder`
2. Upload `index.html` and `README.md`
3. Go to Settings ‚Üí Pages
4. Select "Deploy from main branch"
5. Wait 1-2 minutes
6. Your URL: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/student-ar-builder/`

### 2. Make QR Codes (5 minutes)

**Go to:** https://www.qr-code-generator.com/

Create 4 QR codes for your groups:
- Group 1: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/student-ar-builder/?group=1`
- Group 2: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/student-ar-builder/?group=2`
- Group 3: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/student-ar-builder/?group=3`
- Group 4: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/student-ar-builder/?group=4`

Print them!

### 3. Test It (5 minutes)

Open one QR code on your phone. You should see:
- A 3D scene view
- Colored buttons to add objects
- A "View in AR" button
- Drag and drop works

### 4. Run Your Workshop

Give each group their QR code. They can:
- Add 3D objects (boxes, spheres, etc.)
- Drag them around
- View in real-world AR
- Export as link or screenshot

**That's it. You're done.**

## What The App Does

‚úÖ **No login** - Just scan QR and go
‚úÖ **Mobile & Desktop** - Works on phones with touch
‚úÖ **4 Private Workspaces** - Each group can't mess with others
‚úÖ **Drag & Drop** - Click/tap to position objects
‚úÖ **Live AR Preview** - See it in the real world
‚úÖ **Share Scenes** - Export shareable links
‚úÖ **Free Hosting** - GitHub Pages (forever free)

---

## Key Features Built In

- A-Frame 3D engine (battle-tested)
- Touch + mouse interaction (both work perfectly)
- WebXR AR support (real augmented reality)
- Scene encoding (shareable via URL)
- Responsive design (works on any size screen)
- Available objects: Box, Sphere, Cylinder, Cone, Plane, Dodecahedron

---

## Important: What's NOT Included (by design)

‚ùå **No backend/database** - Everything runs in the browser (faster, simpler, free)
‚ùå **No user accounts** - QR codes are your login
‚ùå **No internet required** - Works offline once loaded (caches everything)
‚ùå **No dependencies to install** - Just HTML + CDN libraries

This keeps it simple and bulletproof.

---

## Customization (If You Want)

Want to add more objects or change colors?

**Edit `index.html`**, find this section:

```html
<button class="asset-btn" onclick="addObject('box', '#e74c3c')">üì¶ Box</button>
```

- First param: A-Frame shape (sphere, cylinder, cone, dodecahedron, plane, box, etc.)
- Second param: Color in hex (#e74c3c = red, #3498db = blue, #f39c12 = orange, etc.)

Add as many as you want! Just paste another button.

## Quick Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| "Page won't load" | Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R |
| "Can't drag objects" | Tap directly on it |
| "AR won't work" | Try Chrome on Android (best support) |
| "Want to add custom 3D models" | Use `.glb` files from sketchfab.com |
| "Scene disappeared" | It's in the URL (`?scene=...`) - save the full link |
